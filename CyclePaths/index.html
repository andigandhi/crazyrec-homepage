		Cycle Paths was formed in 2016 - since then the Band has started to write their own songs.<br>
		After a few lineup changes till 2018 they go strong as a four piece and released their first Record „Teleportation Station“ on the label Crazy Records. This gave them the opportunity to share stages with Bands like BadCopBadCop, Not Available and Bundles.
	</p><p>
		Due to the pandemic they couldn't play any shows and decided to focus on the songwriting and hit the studio again in 2021/22. The result is a new 13 songs Record which is set to release in spring 2023. Currently the band is working on music videos and planning things for the release.
